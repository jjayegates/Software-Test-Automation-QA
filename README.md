-  How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Utilizing the JUnit framework is one great way to know that my code, program or software is functional and secure.  JUnit will allow me to write tests that verify the functionality of individual features of my project and even has a feature called "coverage" that will tell me what percentage of scenatios my code could potentially get into are covered by my tests.  

-  How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs will be iterpreted by following the client requirements of the project.  Furthermore, multiple tests should correspond to each requirement.  

-  How do I approach designing software?
The approach to designing software should be taken with the user of said software in mind.  Every decision that is made needs to be made within the context of how the decision will affect the convenience of the end user.
